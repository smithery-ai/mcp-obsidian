For manual installation, add the following JSON block to your User Settings (JSON) file in VS Code. You can do this by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + P` and typing `Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)`.

Optionally, you can add it to a file called `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace. This will allow you to share the configuration with others.

> Note that the `mcp` key is not needed in the `.vscode/mcp.json` file.

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "inputs": [
      {
        "type": "promptString",
        "id": "vaultPath",
        "description": "Path to Obsidian vault"
      }
    ],
    "servers": {
      "obsidian": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["-y", "mcp-obsidian", "${input:vaultPath}"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```


## Running evals

The evals package loads an mcp client that then runs the index.ts file, so there is no need to rebuild between tests. You can load environment variables by prefixing the npx command. Full documentation can be found [here](https://www.mcpevals.io/docs).

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key  npx mcp-eval evals.ts index.ts
```
